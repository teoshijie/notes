# Accomplishments 

I have a much better understanding of the overall backend structure. During earlier parts of this unit, I follow the instructions in the notes to write my code without fuly understanding what each lines of code means. After this project, I have a better understanding like when to use req.params, req.body, req.sesssions and how routes are name the way they are. 

I also have better understanding of CSS and how to write responsive design code. 

I attempted to write some test codes which I suceeded. However, I am still not good at it and did not have the time to write a robust set of codes. 

I managed to establish had difficulties mapping 2 databases together. However, I accomplished it through Min Shan's guidance.


# Technical Challenges 

Responsive design is done using responsive browser on Firefox. Despite looking fine on responsive view, some pages are still not rendered properly on the phone itself. 

Attempted to integrate the ability to upload photos with notes through multer. However, I am unable to integrate multer with form as it requires 2 separate post routes. 

# Improvements 

Google and facebook authentication 

Ability to detect that username has already been taken and also set minimum characters for password 

Able to sort notes by date 

Able to organise your notes according to tags
